# name-normalizer â€“ Rust version

Open the `src/lib.rs` file in your favorite editor.
The `src/lib.rs` file contains everything you need to start hacking around.

The `normalize` function's skeleton is placed at the top and needs to be implemented.
The corresponding tests are placed below.

The tests are disabled by the `#[ignore]` attribute.
To enable a test, just delete the `#[ignore]` attribute of the corresponding test.
Now the enabled test will check your implementation when executed.

To run the tests, open up a terminal, `cd` into the Rust project (this directory) and run `cargo test`.
Now `cargo` will run all enabled tests and print the test results on your screen.
